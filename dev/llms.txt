[![Lifecycle:
maturing](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing)

This is a custom, restricted template for use by cynkra packages. Please
don’t use it for your own package.

## Usage

Install cynkratemplate.

``` r
devtools::install_github("cynkra/cynkratemplate")
```

Run

``` r
cynkratemplate::use_cynkra_pkgdown()
```

Please ask the person in charge (see website page of the general manual
in clickup) for a plausible subdomain via email or another mean of
communication of their choice.

## Fonts

Our private “Frutiger” fonts are hosted on AWS in the “cynkraweb” S3
bucket. Some browsers (e.g. Firefox) block the font access if the “CORS”
headers are not set correctly.

To allow access, the domain needs to be whitelisted within the CORS
configuration block of the S3 bucket. In addition, he ACL settings of
the bucket must be set to “public read” so the files can actually be
accessed in the first place.

### cynkra blog, dm and similar repositories

The *cynkra blog*, *cynkratemplate*, *dm* and similar repositories use
the same fonts from [cynkra/cynkraweb on
GitHub](https://github.com/cynkra/cynkraweb/blob/main/www/assets/css/base/fonts.css),
specifically `font-family: "frutiger", sans-serif;` with font weights of
`300` (light), `400` (normal), and `700` (bold). Please ensure not to
use **500**, **600**, **bolder**, or other weights, as the browser would
render them using faux styles.

Keep in mind that since the Cynkra blog loads fonts from absolute URLs
(e.g. `src: url("https://cynkra.com/assets/fonts/frutiger-400.woff2") format("woff2");`),
if there is a font update at the [cynkra/cynkraweb GitHub
repository](https://github.com/cynkra/cynkraweb/), the URLs might
change, requiring updates on our end as well.

### Local preview

To see the Frutiger fonts within local previews, you need to allow CORS
for localhost files. This setting is usually off in most browsers and
will hence block resources from a different origin. As the fonts are
served via AWS S3, the origin differs from localhost.

For Chromium-based browsers, the “CORS Unblock” extension does the job.
There should be similar extensions for Firefox and other browsers.
Safari is less strict with CORS and should serve the Frutiger font by
default.
